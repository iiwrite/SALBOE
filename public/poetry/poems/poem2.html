    <div class="poem-text">
      <p>Today it rained, washing away your sins,  
      Cleansing the blood from my wounded skin.  
      Each drop falls harder than before,  
      The wound deepens more and more.</p>

      <p>A question haunts my mind,  
      Can they see through me?  
      Their gaze passes, unfazed,  
      A cycle that spun in countless threads.</p>

      <p>The devil wears an angel's guise,  
      They shake its hands, oblivious to lies.  
      Know the truth, but choose to hide,  
      As if it is a god, they must abide.</p>

      <p>I have seen it all, heard it all,  
      The truth that no one would want to know.  
      If I dare to fell, they will twist my words,  
      Paint me as a liar in their make-believe world.</p>

      <p>When all of them look away,  
      You smile like how a traitor would.  
      My world turns forever blurred,  
      With only your heart and smile clear.</p>
