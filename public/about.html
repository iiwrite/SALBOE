        <h3>Who am I? Why I started this page?</h3>
        <p>
          There’s a certain kind of nervousness that creeps in when someone asks, <em>"What’s your dream?"</em>
          We’ve all felt it at some point, haven’t we? But there was a time when my eyes would light up at that question.
          <strong>"I want to be an engineer."</strong> That was my little dream, the one I clung to like a lighthouse in the fog.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, something changed. My eyes started wandering—from this to that, from certainty to confusion in a heartbeat.
          Indecisiveness seeped into my veins, and a weight settled on my chest, one I couldn’t shake.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why this little corner of the internet came into existence. All the words and emotions racing through my mind—
          I won’t let them stay trapped. Like Dumbledore drawing memories from the mind, I’ll store them here.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope you find something here that stirs you, something that lingers. 
          <strong>Lots of love.</strong>
