    <div class="poem-text">
        <p>I went to lands unknown  
            To collect rubies on my own  
            For each ruby found, I carved  
            Into a heart, with a piece of me inside.</p>
          
            <p>Adorned with roses in a box,  
            And ribbons wrapped all around.  
            I gave them all to you  
            One by one, into your waiting palm.</p>
          
            <p>Love glimmered in your eyes,  
            With a subtle shade of qualm.</p>
          
            <p>In the search for rubies,  
            I found sapphires.  
            With all the sapphires found,  
            I forged them into armor.</p>
          
            <p>I wore the armor over my heart.  
            It kept me safe when you smiled.  
            When my heart skipped with your kiss,  
            It did not let its guard down, even for a while.</p>
          
            <p>Yet it failed when you chose to leave.  
            I am left with sapphire's melt as I grieve.  
            All the red gifted, only the blue remains with me.  
            Take the blue too, leave me colourless, set me free.</p>
