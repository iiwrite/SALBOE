    <div class="poem-text">
      <p>Alfred, Spike, and a house,  
      Planned to grow trees together.  
      Spike went on planting the seedlings,  
      Alfred watered, nurtured, pruned,  
      Did everything the trees necessitated.</p>

      <p>Sprout —  
      Spike didn’t show up,  
      Alfred looked confused.</p>

      <p>Seedlings —  
      Spike didn’t show up,  
      Alfred pondered for the answer.</p>

      <p>Sapling —  
      Spike didn’t show up,  
      Tears stained Alfred’s cheeks.</p>

      <p>Mature tree —  
      Happy Alfred,  
      Spike finally showed up,  
      So did the neighborhood.  
      Spike, persuasive with words,  
      Admired the elegant flowers and appetizing fruits.  
      Gratified with admiration,  
      Shared silver hugs,  
      Gained recognition.</p>

      <p>Ancient trees —  
      Disappointed.</p>

      <p>Snag with cavities —  
      Infuriated Spike,  
      So was the neighborhood,  
      They blamed Alfred,  
      Disheartened trees.</p>

      <p>Obligated mature trees —  
      Altruistic Alfred,  
      Heedless Spike.</p>
